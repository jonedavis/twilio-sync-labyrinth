## Motivation
This project stemmed from an intense 4 hour hack session. With 5 minutes remaining in the session, we finally got the ball to move on the screen. I'll never forget David yelling at the top of his lungs and everyone jumping up and down when we got it to work.

## Next Steps
There is still work to be done:

1. The ball movement needs to be smoothed out
2. There is no final level or end screen
3. Android and iPhone have inverse coordinates
4. The controller webpage could use some visuals
